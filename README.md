# The-Phantom-Menace

This is an implementation of the game Star Wars The Phantom Menace, with a spin, and probably I will make my own game once the engine is up and running, this will be opensource and free offline game.

In the future I might implement an openGL 4 or Vulkan rendering engine, but for now no GPU only CPU.

The 1st implementation will be a 2D top down game, like golden sun, or the likes of it.
The 2nd implementation will be a 2.5/3D game, but for that I need to either implement someone's OpenGl engine or do one by myself.
